## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

<p style="text-align: justify">
This is the final project taught by professor <a href:"https://github.com/julianasinnott">Juliana Sinnot</a> carried out by Group 03 of Class 2 of the first bootcamp of [Proz EducaÃ§Ã£o](https://prozeducacao.com.br/) offered by [Meta](https://about.meta.com/) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). The main objective of the project is to apply the frontend skills acquired throughout the course, to develop a website with an important and relevant theme. Biome addresses sustainability, seeks to re-educate the way millions of Brazilians see the environment and show how we can be more generous with our planet. Doing the right thing should not be something unusual in our reality.
